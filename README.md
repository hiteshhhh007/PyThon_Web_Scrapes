# Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup (A Starter Project)
Hey There! I have uploaded a project based on web scraping using the _BeautifulSoup_ library. This is a starter project and basically it crawls over the IMDb website
and gives us the top movies of all time. The data from IMDb is scraped and produced in python, We also import a _OpenPyXL_ library which basically produces the output onto a excel sheet. So that we get a movie list on the excel along with the ***Rank,Movie Name, Year and IMDb Rating***.









Below is a sample video which shows us how the data is coming on to excel sheet directly from the IMDb website.

As it is visible in the video, once i run the code, an excel file with the name IMDb gets created in the project folder. Opening it you will be able to see the rank, Movie Name, Releas Year and all time IMDb rating.

## How to run this project?
It is simple. Just copy the IMDB_Scraping.py file and paste it onto your local machine. Give the path where you want your excel file needs to be saved. 
**(It is recommended to give the same path as your .py file)** and _Voila!_
