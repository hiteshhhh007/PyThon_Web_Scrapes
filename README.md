# Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup (A Starter Project)
Hey There! I have uploaded a project based on web scraping using the BeautifulSoup library. This is a starter project and basically it crawls over the iDMB website
and gives us the top movies of all time. The data from iDMB is scraped and produced in python, We also import a OpenPyXL library which basically produces the output onto a excel sheet. So that we get a movie list on the excel along with the Rank,Movie Name, Year and iDMB Rating.




Below is a sample video which shows us how the data is coming on to excel sheet directly from the iDMB website.
