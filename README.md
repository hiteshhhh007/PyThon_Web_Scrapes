# Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup (A Starter Project)
Hey There! I have uploaded a project based on web scraping using the _BeautifulSoup_ library. This is a starter project and basically it crawls over the IMDb website
and gives us the top movies of all time. The data from IMDb is scraped and produced in python, We also import a _OpenPyXL_ library which basically produces the output onto a excel sheet. So that we get a movie list on the excel along with the ***Rank,Movie Name, Year and IMDb Rating***.




Below is a sample video which shows us how the data is coming on to excel sheet directly from the IMDb website.
